-- SUMMARY --

The Improved Multi Select module replace the default multi-select boxes with two
panel list and search. The first panel holds the options that are available, and
the second panel holds the options that have been selected. Two panels are
separated by "add" and "remove" buttons. You can select an item from the first
box, click the "add" button, and add it to the second box. Likewise, you can
select an item from the second box, click the "remove" button, and it goes back
into the unselected box. Re-Ordering buttons allow users to move items that
have been selected up and down.

A search box allows users to quickly filter the left column to find items.
Admins can decide how precise users need to be when entering searches.
Options include Exact Match, All Words, and Any Words.
For each option, admins can decide if they want to allow partial words.

Grouping allows users to drill down by category to find items. This is
especially useful when the user has a large list of items to select from.

Grouping works with search to enable cross-filtering.
